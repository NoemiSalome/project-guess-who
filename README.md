# Project Name
This project was about getting famliar with objects, arrays, loops and functions. Creating arrays and objects, accessing attributes in particular objects and filtering them based on their values with functions. As a starter-setting I got a starter HTML, CSS and JS file for a Guess-Who game and the task was to make it work.

## The problem
First off I started playing the Guess-Who game to understand and analyse what steps will need to be done. Then I went over to analizing and "understanding" the given code. What was every part doing, where is the JS file reffering to the HTML file. Then I went through all the steps needed on a piece of paper to split them into steps to see what parts of the HTML I will need where and where the event listeners will be needed. Now having more or less a good overview I felt ready to start with coding. It have to say that I started this project late in the week (Friday night). So I had access to all the lectures and the already asked and answered questions by my team and classmates. Also I could benefit from the friday meeting, where my team could explain their struggles, problems and solution. So I had a lot of information and ressources before starting coding, which went quite smoothly with all the information and hints I got.
