# Bootcamp-Project #04: Guess Who Game
This project was about getting famliar with objects, arrays, loops and functions - Creating arrays and objects, accessing attributes in particular objects and filtering them based on their values with functions. As a starter-setting I got a starter HTML, CSS and JS file for a Guess-Who game and the task was to make the game work.

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- JavaScript (create & manipulate arrays, loops, objects)
- Array methods (for each(), filter())
- manipulating DOM using JavaScript
- translate the logic / flow of the Guess Who Game into code

I started off by playing the game myself and focusing on what steps will be needed. In addition to that I got provided with some hints in the starter code, which kind of set up the structure for the flow of the code. Following this structure and doing many console.log's along the way made the game work quite smoothly. This project helped a lot with understanding the flow of code, break a "system" into seperate steps and put them together into a working "system".
